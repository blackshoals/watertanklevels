This is a water tank monitoring and pump controller project using the A02YYUW waterproof ultrasonic sensor and  the ESP-NOW wireless protocol for wireless communication. There are two tanks about 100m apart, an upper storage and a lower storage/collector with a 12V pump attached. The system consists of 3 units: 1) a remote sensor at the upper tank powered by solar power and an 18650 battery that wakes up once an hour and transmits the tank level; 2) a sensor/ pump controller at the lower tank hardwired to the main 12v solar array that relays ESP-NOW messages; 3) a remote display unit that receives the tank level messages and uses 2 buttons to set whether: a) the pump is in auto mode or not; and b) manual pump control. An ESP32-WROOM-32U, chosen mainly for its external antenna connection, makes up each sensor with a high current relay board and temperature sensor added to the pump controller, and the remote display is a Lilygo T-Display-S3. Micropython was used to program the sensor mainly for ease of use while Arduino was used for the remote display as Micropython support was limited at the time of writing. SquareLine Studio was used to create the remote display screen and worked very well. Overall, the goal was to have the lower tank pump fill the upper tank during the rainy season when it is unattended, then sleep during the winter when it is too cold to pump.
